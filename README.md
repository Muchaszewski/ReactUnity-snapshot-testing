# ReactJS Unity testing platform

This project will test the integration of ReactJS and Unity3D. The goal is to create a platform that will allow the user to create a list of tests, that can be run in Electron, Unity3D, or both. The tests will render and be screenshoted in both environments, and the results will be compared. The user will be able to see the results of the tests, and will be able to see the differences between the two environments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
